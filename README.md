# User Stories

This blog is inteded for users to be able to visit and catch up on the latest technological
updates to the languages that I take interest in, JS, React, HTML, CSS, Python, and Django

Users will be able to keep up to date with the latest packages, and so on, including Deno.

Some of the articles will show examples of code, and how to accomplish certain tasks.

# Authors

In the future, I plan to seek out contributors to the blog, as well as maintain it myself to keep
my skills sharp and in focus, especially during the job search so that I do not fall behind or get
rusty.
